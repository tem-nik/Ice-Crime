# ICE CRIME :icecream:

## Project 2 - Landing Page (Front End Developer Udacity Nanodegree)

### created with HTML, CSS, Javascript (Vanilla)

### Project Description
The **Ice Crime** website is a landing page, created as part of my FEND Nanodegree course.
The task was to build a multi section landing page with dynamically built navigation, _scroll to top_ button and 'highlighted' sections - for user to see what section he is actively viewing. In addition the navigation items when clicked smoothly scroll to the corresponding section.

### The Ice Crime idea 
I think many of us been there... On a hot summer day impatiently waiting in a queue, whilst visualising all the mouthwatering ice cream flavours we are craving for, and eventually deciding on the lucky winner (or two) we are so looking forward to get. And then after many ice creams of waiting, there it comes - the ultimate question: What flavour would you like? And you effortlessly say: one scoop of rocky road please, and it all seems fine, until the glossy metal ice cream scoop reaches that rocky road, and it hits you - you don't want rocky road, you want the mint chocolate next to it, or a cookie dough or maybe all of them at once. Deciding on the ice cream flavour can be quite a challenge, so check out **Ice Crime** to be prepared and establish what type of `ice cream`inal you truly are?
